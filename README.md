With the help of the "ArtifiWith the help of the "Artificial Intelligence A-Z™ Learn How To Build An AI" course on UDEMY I have managed to create a self-driving car that goes back and forth between point A (Airport) and point B (Downtown) and that recognizes sand on the road and avoids it.
In the "Before AI" section of the video, The car runs without its brain (AI deactivated), it explores the environments aimelesly but it recognizes the sand and knows to slow down when it steps on it.
